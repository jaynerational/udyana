> *"a gentle space for your thoughts to breathe"*

A mindful journaling app where emotions are felt, expressed, and allowed to pass. Write your thoughts, watch them slowly fade over 24 hours, or preserve them forever in your personal "garden" of memories.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Presence over permanence.** Most journaling apps encourage you to keep everything forever. udyāna does the opposite — it reminds you that emotions are temporary. Thoughts naturally decay, like petals falling from a flower.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Fading Thoughts** — Text naturally decays over 24 hours
- **Emotion Detection** — AI-free keyword analysis identifies 7 emotion types
- **Garden Visualization** — Preserved thoughts bloom as flowers in a canvas constellation
- **Trading Card Export** — Share your "meadow map" in Square or Story format
- **Ambient Atmosphere** — Typing velocity particles, spotlight, and grain effects

## 🤖 Honesty Note

**This project was vibe-coded.** The majority of the code was written with AI assistance (Claude/Anthropic). I designed the product, defined the UX philosophy, and directed the implementation — but I didn't write most of it by hand.

This is an experiment in:
- Human-AI collaborative development
- Shipping fast with AI tooling
- Being transparent about how modern software gets built

If you're evaluating this for a job or collaboration, know that my strength is in **product thinking, design direction, and orchestrating AI to build real things** — not in memorizing syntax.
